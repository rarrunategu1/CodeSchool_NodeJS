WHAT IS NODE.JS?
it allows you to build a scalable network app using javascript on the server side.

Node can basically be a wrapper to the V8 javascript Runtime and engine like my chrome browser.
Node provides additonal functionalities for network apps.
Node and the Runtime is mostly written in C code which  makes it fast

WHAT CAN I BUILD?
-I can build a chat server(Websocket server)
-Fast File Upload client
-ad server
-real-time data apps

It's a single threaded server for network communication

BLOCKING CODE VS NON-BLOCKING CODE
- a nonblocking code would do something and "call back" that function
Without a callback function it's a blocking code
Blocking code files read one after the other where the nonblocking read parallel and work faster that way


Javascript allows us to do evented programming easily using event loops that are nonblocking

EVENTS IN THE DOM

Many objects in Node emit events inherited from the Event Emmitter constructor.
net.Server class emits the request event
reading a file returns a stream inherited from the event emitter as a data event

The example from codeschool video below shows a custom EventEmitter for error events.  It can also be done with Warn and Info events:
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
var logger = new EventEmitter();
logger.on('error', function(message){
console.log('ERR: ' + message);
});
logger.emit('error', 'Spilled Milk);
logger.emit('error', 'Eggs Cracked');

Another example on how to add event listeners in node is:
var server = http.createServer();
server.on('request', function(request, response){...});

to listen to close event:
server.on('close', function ......etc.
